# Project Title: Find Me Food

### What and Why?

This project is a web application that gives user a list of restaurants near a desired location that will each cost 10 dollars or less for a meal. Additionally, for the restaurants that qualify, a list of items from each restaurant that cost 10 dollars or less will be provided. This application will speed up the process of finding a budget meal. 


### For whom?

The goal endusers for this software are young adults around ages 18-30 that live on a budget. More specifically: college students. 


### How?

The user will specify their location in the web app by specifying a central location and giving a radius of distance they are willing to travel from that point. The location can also be specified by clicking on a point in the map. Next, a list of restaurant will pop up. Once a restaurant is clicked, a list of its food items will display. The restaurants and its items can be shown either as pop ups on a map or in a list format. 


### Scope

With this application's focus audience, the main focus will be functionality rather than design. A group of 4-5 students should be able to complete this task in one semester.
